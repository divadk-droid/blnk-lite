**Long (250 words)**
BLNK Risk Gate is a comprehensive security infrastructure designed specifically for AI agents in the DeFi ecosystem. Operating on Base Network and integrated with Virtuals Protocol (aGDP), BLNK provides mandatory pre-trade risk assessment that protects AI agents from malicious smart contracts.

The core offering is a lightning-fast API that returns PASS/WARN/BLOCK decisions in just 2ms with a single RPC call. The system analyzes smart contract bytecode to detect dangerous patterns including mintable functions, blacklist capabilities, upgradeable proxies, and suspicious code patterns.

BLNK's tokenomics are designed to be deflationary and issuer-friendly. The BLNK token features a 50% automatic burn mechanism on all payment fees, creating continuous deflationary pressure. Token holders can stake BLNK to unlock tiered benefits ranging from 5 daily API calls (FREE tier) to 10,000 calls (ENTERPRISE tier).

High-tier stakers (50,000+ BLNK) gain access to exclusive Alpha feeds showing trending safe contracts before they become widely known. The platform also features a real-time burn tracker dashboard visualizing the deflationary spiral.

With enterprise-grade security, sub-2ms latency, and deflationary tokenomics, BLNK Risk Gate is positioned as the essential security layer for the emerging A2A (Agent-to-Agent) economy.
